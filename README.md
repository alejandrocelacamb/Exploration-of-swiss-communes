# Final Project – First Course of the COS in Applied Data Science: Machine Learning (EPFL Extension School)

This is the final project for the first course of the Certificate of Open Studies "Applied Data Science: Machine Learning", currently pursued at the EPFL Extension School. This project was completed individually and aims to apply the concepts learned during the course in a realistic context, using the tools and methods studied.

## 📝 General Description

This repository contains an exploration of all Swiss communes. It includes exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and insights related to probability and linear algebra, laying the groundwork for future modeling.

## 🎯 Goal

To generate insights and visualizations from a real-world dataset, and extract probability and linear algebra information to support potential future modeling tasks.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools

- Python (3.x)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Exploration and Data Manipulation

- Performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, missing values, and correlations.
- Conducted data cleaning and extracted relevant insights.

## 📊 Visualization

- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Scatter plots

## 👤 Author

This project was entirely developed by **Alejandro Cela Camba**, as part of the COS "Applied Data Science: Machine Learning" at the EPFL Extension School.
